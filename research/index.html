<h4 id="31-preview-path-tracking-control-with-delay-compensation-for-autonomous-vehicles">3.1) Preview Path Tracking Control with Delay Compensation for Autonomous Vehicles</h4>
<p>How to achieve smooth, accurate and computationally efficient steering control? We address this issue by developing a discrete-time preview steering controller, which can smoothly deal with future road curvature and whose tracking performance is comparable to MPC but the computational load is greatly reduced. Experiments on an automated Lincoln MKZ validated its improved tracking accuracy and smoothness.</p>

<h4 id="32-safeguard-protected-preview-lane-keeping-control">3.2) Safeguard Protected Preview Lane Keeping Control</h4>
<p>How to bound tracking errors to a certain safe level for better safety? In this paper, we solve this challenge by developing a preview lane keeping control supervised by a safeguard controller. The safeguard controller intervenes in the preview control if and only if the tracking error is approaching the safety boundary. The proposed controls were implemented on a self-driving vehicle platform and tested on open roads and in the Mcity test facility.</p>

<h4 id="33-preview-path-tracking-control-with-delay-compensation">3.3) Preview Path Tracking Control with Delay Compensation</h4>
<p>Does your self-driving car run with unexpected slalom and steering oscillation? If yes, then one potential cause is the system time delay and steering lag. This paper targets this challenge and presents a delay-compensated preview steering control design, which can lower tracking errors and significantly improve stability margin compared to controls ignoring delay and lag. All the controller design, performance analysis, and experimental validation on a self-driving MKZ platform are detailed.</p>

<h4 id="34-design-and-test-of-speed-tracking-control-for-the-self-driving-lincoln-mkz-platform">3.4) Design and Test of Speed Tracking Control for the Self-Driving Lincoln MKZ Platform</h4>
<p>How to smoothly and accurately track a given speed considering the powertrain nonlinearity? Taking the Lincoln MKZ as an example, two computationally efficient, smooth, and accurate speed-tracking control algorithms are presented, i.e., 1) an optimal preview control if future information (reference speed and road slope profiles) is provided a priori, and 2) a PID+C control if the information is unavailable. All controls are validated by an MKZ platform at Mcity.</p>

<h3 id="2-building-hardware-platform-and-software-system-for-self-driving-vehicles">2. Building Hardware Platform and Software System for Self-Driving Vehicles</h3>
<p>Launched by Prof. Huei Peng at 9/2016, supported by Mcity, this OpenCAV project aims to provide a reusable and shared self-driving research platform to UofM and Mcity-Member researchers. Xu serves as the core researcher of this project from 10/2016.</p>
<p>Xu specifically improved the hardware platform for the Lincoln MKZ, e.g., activate all sensors (integrated by Autonomoustuff), develop data recording/conversion software, set up a distributed computing framework, develop DSRC/5G based V2X drivers and a by-wire control interface for preventing unsafe commands and streamlining underlying control of vehicle’s actuators. Alongside the hardware platform, the above-mentioned algorithms and software for robust and intelligent decision making, path planning, and motion control are also deployed.</p>

<h3 id="1-developing-eco-driving-strategies-for-self-driving-vehicles-with-hybrid-or-conventional-powertrains">1. Developing Eco-Driving Strategies for Self-Driving Vehicles with Hybrid or Conventional Powertrains</h3>
<p>How to drive the vehicle with minimal fuel consumption? During Xu’s Ph.D. project, he designed speed profile optimization algorithms and powertrain control strategies for self-driving vehicles with hybrid electric powertrain or conventional powertrain to minimize energy consumption. Nonlinear constrained fuel-optimal control problems are formulated and solved by  Legendre pseudo-spectral method to parse the eco-driving laws. Are you curious about how to use minimal fuel (energy) to accelerate a car, cruising on highway (for both conventional vehicles and HEV), and drive on varying slopes? Please refer to the following papers for detailed algorithms, performance, and the underlying mechanisms.</p>
