      <description>Shaobing Xu is an assistant research scientist working with Prof. Huei Peng at the Department of Mechanical Engineering (ME) and Mcity, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He received his Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2016. His research focuses on motion control, decision making, and path planning for automated and connected vehicles. He is currently concentrating on developing self-driving technologies and addressing engineering and theoretical challenges in this process.</description>

      <description>A. Current Focuses  Prediction of surrounding agents Motion planning with uncertainties Apply 5G and AI to enhance simulation and tests  B. Visited Topics 4. Intelligent Motion Planning This project developed intelligent algorithms and software for automatic routing, decision making, and trajectory generation of self-driving vehicles. Both model based and reinforcement learning based algorithms are explored for improved robustness and intelligence. More details coming later.
